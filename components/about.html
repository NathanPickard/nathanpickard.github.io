  <p>Hi, my name is Nathan Pickard and I am a full stack Javascript developer. I create web apps that enhance the user's daily
    life, whether they are trying to track there diet while in the browser or looking up the local PDX weather on my native
    android weather app. I have a knack for understanding how all the elements of an application fit together by leveraging
    my full stack Javascript skills and technical aptitude. I have a proven ability to work effectively with a team to develop
    fully functioning web applications while I was taking advanced software development in full-stack JavaScript as a student
    at Code Fellows PDX. The endless possibilities of ever evolving web development inspire me to enable the end user experience
    technologies that enrich their daily lives and empower them to reach their goals. I'm currently looking for an opportunity as
    a full stack Javascript developer with a lean towards front end development in AngularJS.</p>
