    <h3>Hi there!</h3>

    <p id="bio">My name is Nathan Pickard and I am a full stack Javascript developer living in the Portland, OR metro area. I'm also
      a problem solving handyman with a background in hardware assembly and maintenance. I create web apps that enhance the
      user's daily life, whether they are trying to track there diet while in the browser or looking up the local PDX weather
      on my native android weather app.
      <br>
      <br> I have a knack for understanding how all the elements of an application fit together by leveraging my full stack Javascript
      skills and technical aptitude. I have a proven ability to work effectively with a team to develop fully functioning
      web applications while I was taking advanced software development in full-stack JavaScript as a student at Code Fellows
      PDX.
      <br>
      <br> Intuitively utilizing software with the latest technologies in web development to make a user's experiences more effective
      is what I believe in. The endless possibilities of ever evolving web development ecosystem inspire me to enable the
      end user to experience technologies that enrich their daily lives while empowering and inspiring them to reach their
      goals.
      <br>
      <br> I'm currently looking for an opportunity as a full stack Javascript developer with a lean towards front end development
      in Angular.</p>
